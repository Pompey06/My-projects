Modulord is a display typeface inspired by square and rough forms of architecture, infrastructure and analog electronics. The font characters are square with missing parts and look like blocks attached to each other. Modulord is designed to be used in large sizes for headings, not for extended fragments of the main text. 

This font is absolutely free for personal and commercial use.
